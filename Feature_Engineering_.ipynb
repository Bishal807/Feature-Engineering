        "2. What is correlation?\n",
        "- Correlation measures the relationship between two variables. It ranges from -1 to 1. A positive correlation means both variables move in the same direction, while a negative correlation means they move in opposite directions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
